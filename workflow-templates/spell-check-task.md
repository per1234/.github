# "Spell Check" workflow (Task)

Workflow file: [spell-check-task.yml](spell-check-task.yml)

Use [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) to check for commonly misspelled words in the repository files.

This is the version of the workflow for projects using the [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/) task runner tool.

## Installation

The `codespell` tool dependency is managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

Install Poetry by following these instructions:<br />
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

If your project does not already use Poetry, you can initialize the [`pyproject.toml`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/) file using these commands:

```
poetry init --python="^3.9" --dev-dependency="codespell@^2.0.0"
poetry install
```

If already using Poetry, add the tool using this command:

```
poetry add --dev "codespell@^2.0.0"
```

Make sure to commit the resulting `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.

## Commit message

```
Add CI workflow to check for commonly misspelled words

On every push, pull request, and periodically, use the codespell-project/actions-codespell action to check for commonly
misspelled words.

In the event of a false positive, the problematic word should be added, in all lowercase, to the ignore-words-list field
of ./.codespellrc. Regardless of the case of the word in the false positive, it must be in all lowercase in the ignore
list. The ignore list is comma-separated with no spaces.
