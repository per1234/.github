# GitHub Actions workflow templates

A collection of reusable [GitHub Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart#creating-your-first-workflow). These can be added to any repository under the organization via [GitHub's "Actions" web UI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/sharing-workflows-with-your-organization), but copying the files to the repository does the same thing so it's not required to use the web UI.

While some workflows can be added to any repository without any modification, others need to be configured for each project. Comments in the workflow explain what needs to be done. Additional instructions, as well as markup for readme badges and stock commit messages, are provided in the .md file named after the workflow file.
