    stock.

  description: Related to repository infrastructure
- name: "topic: code"
  color: "00ffff"
  description: Related to content of the project itself

- name: "type: imperfection"
  color: "ff0000"
  description: Perceived defect in any part of project
  aliases:
    - bug

- name: "type: enhancement"
  color: "008000"
  description: Proposed improvement
  aliases:
    - enhancement
- name: "type: support"
  color: "ff0000"
  description: "OT: Request for help using the project"
  aliases:
    - question
  notes: |
    All support request issues must be closed as "conclusion: invalid", redirecting the user to the Arduino forum, but
    it's still useful to label the closed issues and this type doesn't fit into the imperfection/enhancement dichotomy.
