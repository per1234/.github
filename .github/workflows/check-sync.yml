# This repository contains duplicate copies of workflow assets and templates
# Workflow assets and templates are also used in this repository's CI system.
# In order to get notifications from Dependabot about outdated action versions used in the templates,
# the workflows in /workflow-templates must always be synced with the ones in
# /workflow-templates/dependabot/workflow-template-copies/.github/workflows/
# If this workflow fails, run workflow-templates/etc/sync.sh and commit.
